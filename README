Thumbor is a smart imaging service. It enables on-demand crop, resizing and flipping of images.

Hbase is a column oriented database from the hadoop ecosystem.
  https://hbase.apache.org/

This module provide support for Hadoop Hbase as large auto replicant key/value backend storage for images in Thumbor.


To install it (on linux ubuntu/debian)
I based it on the Hbase packages provide by Cloudera (for the pyvows tests) 
Here for getting packages from APT: 
https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/CDHDOC/CDH3+Installation#CDH3Installation-InstallingCDH3onUbuntuandDebianSystems

#dependace for testing
aptitude install haddop-hbase-master hadoop-hbase-thirft 

# pip will install thumbor and all its dependences and hbase_thrift and its dependances
# they need compilation tools for some binary modules and some library dev for image manipulation

#some of this package may be available via pip also
aptitude install python-pip python-redis python-pymongo python-opencv python-dev 

# needed to get thumbor pyvows tests pass (maybe most recent version of mongodb can be available on 10gen repository, use "mongodb-10gen" so, cf http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages )
aptitude install mongodb-server redis-server

aptitude install dpkg-dev gcc libcurl4-openssl-dev libpng12-0 libpng3 libpngwriter0c2 libjasper1 pngtools libtiff4 libtiffxx0c2 libtiff-tools libjpeg62 libjpeg-progs openexr libjasper-dev libjpeg62-dev libpng++-dev libpng12-dev libpnglite-dev libpngwriter0-dev libtiff4-dev

pip install thumbor_hbase
